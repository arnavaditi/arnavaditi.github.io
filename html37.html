<ol type="A"><h1>Autotrophic nutrition</h1>
<li>In autotrophic nutrition organism prepares its food from simple substances present in the surrounding.
<li>Heterotrophic nutrition
<p><h3>ans:In heterotrophic nutrition organism obtains food from digesting organic compounds.</h3>
</ol>
<p><h1>Types of In heterotrophic nutrition</h1>
<ol type="A">
<li>Saprophic
<li>Parasitic
<li>Holozoic
</ol>
<p><h1>Saprotrophic nutrition</h1>
<p><h3>ans:the organisms which obtain their food from dead and decaying organic matter of dead plants, dead animals and other organic matter are called saprophytes.</h3></p>
<br>
<p><h1>Parasitic nutrition</h1>
<p><h3>ans:Endo parasites are those parasites which obtain their food from their host by remaining inside the body of their host. For example, Ascaris, plasmodium vivax and tape worm.</h3></p>
<br>
<p><h1>Holozoic nutrition</h1>
<p><h3>ans:Holozoic nutrition is a method of nutrition that involves the ingestion of liquid or solid organic material, digestion, absorption and assimilation of it to utilize it. It includes taking in the complex substances and converting them into simpler forms. Example, proteins can be broken into amino acids.</h3></p>
