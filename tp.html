<dt><center><h1>Trnsportation in plants.</center></h1>
<dd><h3>Transpiration is the process of water movement through a plant and its evaporation from aerial parts, such as leaves, stems and flowers. Water is necessary for plants but only a small amount of water taken up by the roots is used for growth and metabolism. The remaining 97–99.5% is lost by transpiration and guttation.Leaf surfaces are dotted with pores called stomata, and in most plants they are more numerous on the undersides of the foliage. The stomata are bordered by guard cells and their stomatal accessory cells (together known as stomatal complex) that open and close the pore.Transpiration occurs through the stomatal apertures, and can be thought of as a necessary "cost" associated with the opening of the stomata to allow the diffusion of carbon dioxide gas from the air for photosynthesis. Transpiration also cools plants, changes osmotic pressure of cells, and enables mass flow of mineral nutrients and water from roots to shoots. Two major factors influence the rate of water flow from the soil to the roots: the hydraulic conductivity of the soil and the magnitude of the pressure gradient through the soil. Both of these factors influence the rate of bulk flow of water moving from the roots to the stomatal pores in the leaves via the xylem,
The cohesion-tension theory explains how leaves pull water through the xylem. Water molecules stick together, or exhibit cohesion. As a water molecule evaporates from the surface of the leaf, it pulls on the adjacent water molecule, creating a continuous flow of water through the plant.</h3>

<dt><h2>What do you mean by transportation in animals?</h2>
<dd><h2>The system which pumps the fluid tissue to transport it throughout the body is called the circulatory system. Human circulatory system comprises of heart, blood and a network of blood vessels. The oxygenated blood is supplied to all the organs by arteries branching out as capillaries.</h2>
<dt><h2><center>What is Blood?</h2>
<dd><h2>Blood is a red coloured liquid which contain in our body.Bood is red because it contains pigment called haemoglobin in its red cell.Blood is a connective tissue.</h2>
<dt><h3>The main component are:</h3> 
<dd><h3>1.Plasma,<br>
2.Red blood corpusles(RBC)<br>
3.White blood corpusles(WBC)<br>
4.Platelets.<br>
<p><h2><center>what is Plasma?</h2></p>
<p><h3>1.it is a liquid part of the blood is called plasma.</h3></p>
<p><h3>2.(RBC)These carry oxygen&nbspO<sub>2</sub> from the lungs to all the cells of the body.</p></h3>
<p><h3>3.(WBC)White blood cells fight infection and protect us from diseases.</p></h3>
<p><h3>4.Platelets help in the coagulaation of blood (or clotting of blood) in a cut or wound.</p></h3>
<br>
<p><h2><center>Functions of blood?</p></h2>
<dt><h3>The important function of blood in our body as follows:</h3>
<dd><h3>1.Blood carries <b>oxygen</b> from the lungs to different part of the  body.</h3>
<dd><h3>2.Blood carries <b>carbon dioxide</b>  from the body cells to the lungs for breathing out.</h3>
<dd><h3>3.Blood carries <b>digested food</b> from the small intestine to aall the part of the body.</h3>
<dd><h3>4.Blood carries <b>hormones</b> from the endocrine gland to different part of the body.</h3>
<dd><h3>5.Blood regulaates the body temperature. this is because of the blood capillaries in our skin help to leep our body tempreature constant at about 37*C.</h3>
